## About
I am a multidisciplinary Earth scientist and geochemist with passion for combining experimental laboratory work with field work. My current research focuses on the formation of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) by abiotic synthesis. Identfiyng abiotic formation mechanisms of VOSC may provide insights for the emergence of life on Earth as some VOSC were demonstrated to aid the formation of peptide bonds. Alongside my research, I teach geology courses at the Open University of Israel. <br/>

## Research interests
- Abiotic synthesis of organic sulfur compounds and their role in the emergence of life on Earth.
- Evolution of biomarkers in organic matter from the Paleozoic Era with emphasis on anoxic environments.
- The sulfur and carbon cycles in the subsurface from processes during diagenesis of organic matter up to formation of sulfur-compounds during catagenesis and cracking of fossilized organic matter.

## When not in the lab
I volunteer at the Mineralogy and Petrology collection at the National Natural History Collections ([NNHC](https://nnhc.huji.ac.il/?lang=en)) and take part in various cave surveys (for example in the [Levana Cave](https://youtu.be/c5MqvLElpGU?si=L0QZ_CuWPZZLStMp)) as a member of the Israeli Cave Research Center ([ICRC](https://www.malham.info/))

## Achievments and things I am proud of
### *Protecting the Ayalon cave*
In late 2021 I was invited to speak at the [Israeli Planning Administration (IPA)](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/iplan/govil-landing-page) as part of a scientific panel focused on the importance of the Ayalon cave. My presentation highlighted the risks faced by the local aquifer due to introduction of organic-contaminants, heavy metals and subsequent change of the aquifer redox state- all of which were expected to occur due to [proposed construction of a railroad line and introduction of runoff directly into the groundwater](https://mavat.iplan.gov.il/SV4/1/99000957231/310). The joint scientific effort led to [changes](https://new.huji.ac.il/news/%D7%91%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%98%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%90-%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%92%D7%A2) in the original construction plan and the formation of a long-term monitoring project at the cave and surrounding aquifer. Detailed story of this conservation campaign was [publised](https://doi.org/10.1002/inc3.20) in *Integrative Conservation*.

### *Identification of a pollutant on the Israeli coast ("Tar pollution")*
In February 2022, amidst the covid pandemic, the Israeli coastline was covered by vast quantities of tar-like pollutant. Rapid sampling and subsequent molecular and biomerker analysis allowed me to conclude, within days of the pollution event, the pollutant is most likely a crude oil rather than tar- therefore implying a different strategy for source-identification and treatment.<br/> My findings were [submitted](/assets/documents/Feb_2022_oil_spill_report.pdf) to the Israeli Ministry of Environment (and later to the [press](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001362101)), yet were originally ignored. Following a year, the Israeli Ministry of Environment published the result of their analysis and [acknowledged](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/opinion-column_rani_amir) the pollutant is indeed a crude oil.

### *Study of an oil spill in arid condition*
I was a part of a group that studied the chemistry of oil spilled at the Evrona Nature Reserve. Our joint effort led to identification of previously unknown pollution event at the area and helped understand the mechanisms of oil degredation in the desert soil under arid conditions. The work was published in [Nimrod Arvatz's Msc work](https://primo.bgu.ac.il/discovery/delivery/972BGU_INST:972BGU/12265289500004361).

All standard data (location, depth etc...) is available when clicking each borehole. In addition, publications and reports of relevant wells are referenced therein.
