## Research interests

My Research focuses on organic compounds in the geosphere and the use of stable sulfur isotopes to better understand the sulfur and carbon cycle in the subsurface.
I am interested in the role organic sulfur compounds play in preservation of organic matter and subsequent cracking of kerogen under thermal stress conditions.

## Other interests
I am an active member of the Israeli Cave Research Center ([ICRC](https://www.malham.info/))<br/> I am the manager of the Mineralogy and Petrology collection at the National Natural History Collections ([NNHC](https://nnhc.huji.ac.il/?lang=en))

## Achievments and things I am proud of
### *Saving Ayalon cave*
Was invited to speak at the Ministry

### *Identification of a pollutant on the Israeli coast ("Tar pollution")*
Our laboratory recieved samples of the "tar" that contaminated the Israeli coastline in February 2022. Within a few days I analyzed the contaminant and concluded it is most likely a crude oil rather than tar. My [report](/assets/documents/Feb_2022_oil_spill_report.pdf) was submitted the the Israeli Ministry of Environment (and later to the press) who originally ignored it but after a year [acknowledged](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/opinion-column_rani_amir) the pollutant is indeed a crude oil
