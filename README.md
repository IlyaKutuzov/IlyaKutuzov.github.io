## About
I am a PhD candidte at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My project focuses on volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) - these compounds occur naturally in natural gas and are known to degrade the gas/petroleum quality and pose a heatlh risk to exposed workers and nearby communities. Often, these sulfur compounds are accompanied by H<sub>2</sub>S which is highly poisonus, corrosive and explosive.<br/>
The aims of my project are to identify the various VOSC in natural gases, understand their pathways of formation and possible sinks and finally, provide a VOSC-based-proxy for H<sub>2</sub>S presence and sources within a given reservoir, or even basin.

## Research interests
My main interests are:
- The sulfur and carbon cycles in the subsurface from processes during diagenesis of organic matter up to formation of sulfur-compounds during catagenesis and cracking of fossilized organic matter.
- Transport of organic pollutants from oil spills to soil, ground water and their interactions with the mineral phase.
- Source rocks in the Southern Levant region- Many oil and gas occurences in the area are yet to be linked to their source rocks. Identification of source rocks in the area is of major importance for reconstraction of paleoenvironmental conditions on land and at the deposition basin.

## When not in the lab
I manage of the Mineralogy and Petrology collection at the National Natural History Collections ([NNHC](https://nnhc.huji.ac.il/?lang=en)) and take part in various cave surveys as a member of the Israeli Cave Research Center ([ICRC](https://www.malham.info/))

## Achievments and things I am proud of
### *Saving Ayalon cave*
In early 2022 I was invited to speak at the [Israeli Planning Administration (IPA)](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/iplan/govil-landing-page) as part of a scientific panel regarding the importance of the Ayalon cave. My presentation focused on the risks faced by the local aquifer due to introduction of organic-contaminants and changing of the aquifer redox state- both of which were expected to occur due to [proposed construction of a railroad line](https://mavat.iplan.gov.il/SV4/1/99000957231/310). The joint scientific effort led [changes](https://new.huji.ac.il/news/%D7%91%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%98%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%90-%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%92%D7%A2) in the original construction plan and the formation of a long-term monitoring project at the cave and surrounding aquifer.

### *Identification of a pollutant on the Israeli coast ("Tar pollution")*
Our laboratory recieved samples of the "tar" that contaminated the Israeli coastline in February 2022. Within a few days I analyzed the contaminant and concluded it is most likely a crude oil rather than tar- therefore implying a different strategy for source-identification and treatment.<br/> My [report](/assets/documents/Feb_2022_oil_spill_report.pdf) was submitted the the Israeli Ministry of Environment (and later to the [press](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001362101)) who originally ignored it but after a year [acknowledged](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/opinion-column_rani_amir) the pollutant is indeed a crude oil.

### *Study of an oil spill in arid condition*
I was a part of a group that studied the chemistry of oil spilled at the Evrona Nature Reserve. Our joint effort led to identification of previously unknown pollution event at the area and helped understand the mechanisms of oil degredation in the desert soil under arid conditions. The work was published in Nimrod Arvatz's Msc work.
