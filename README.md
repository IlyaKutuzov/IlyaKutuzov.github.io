## About
I am a lecturer and course coordinator at [The Open University of Israel](https://www.openu.ac.il/en/pages/default.aspx) and performing research at the Institute of Earth Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My research project focuses on the formation of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) by abiotic synthesis. Better understanding the formation mechanisms of VOSC may provide insights for the emergance of life on Earth as some VOSC are considered a precursor for amino acids in the prebiotic Earth.<br/>

## Research interests
- The sulfur and carbon cycles in the subsurface from processes during diagenesis of organic matter up to formation of sulfur-compounds during catagenesis and cracking of fossilized organic matter.
- Abiotic synthesis of organic sulfur compounds and their role in the emergence of life on Earth.
- Evolution of biomarkers in organic matter from the Paleozoic Era with emphasis on anoxic environments.
- Transport of organic pollutants from oil spills to soil, ground water and their interactions with the mineral phase.

## When not in the lab
I volunteer at the Mineralogy and Petrology collection at the National Natural History Collections ([NNHC](https://nnhc.huji.ac.il/?lang=en)) and take part in various cave surveys as a member of the Israeli Cave Research Center ([ICRC](https://www.malham.info/))

## Achievments and things I am proud of
### *Saving Ayalon cave*
In late 2021 I was invited to speak at the [Israeli Planning Administration (IPA)](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/iplan/govil-landing-page) as part of a scientific panel focused on the importance of the Ayalon cave. My presentation highlighted the risks faced by the local aquifer due to introduction of organic-contaminants and changing of the aquifer redox state- both of which were expected to occur due to [proposed construction of a railroad line](https://mavat.iplan.gov.il/SV4/1/99000957231/310). The joint scientific effort led to [changes](https://new.huji.ac.il/news/%D7%91%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%98%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%90-%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%92%D7%A2) in the original construction plan and the formation of a long-term monitoring project at the cave and surrounding aquifer. Detailed story of this conservation campaign was [publised](https://doi.org/10.1002/inc3.20) in *Integrative Conservation*.

### *Identification of a pollutant on the Israeli coast ("Tar pollution")*
Our laboratory recieved samples of the "tar" that contaminated the Israeli coastline in February 2022. Within a few days I analyzed the contaminant and concluded it is most likely a crude oil rather than tar- therefore implying a different strategy for source-identification and treatment.<br/> My [report](/assets/documents/Feb_2022_oil_spill_report.pdf) was submitted the the Israeli Ministry of Environment (and later to the [press](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001362101)) who originally ignored it but after a year [acknowledged](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/opinion-column_rani_amir) the pollutant is indeed a crude oil.

### *Study of an oil spill in arid condition*
I was a part of a group that studied the chemistry of oil spilled at the Evrona Nature Reserve. Our joint effort led to identification of previously unknown pollution event at the area and helped understand the mechanisms of oil degredation in the desert soil under arid conditions. The work was published in [Nimrod Arvatz's Msc work](https://primo.bgu.ac.il/discovery/delivery/972BGU_INST:972BGU/12265289500004361).
