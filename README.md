## About

My Research focuses on organic compounds in the geosphere and the use of stable sulfur isotopes to better understand the sulfur and carbon cycle in the subsurface.
I am interested in the role organic sulfur compounds play in preservation of organic matter and subsequent cracking of kerogen under thermal stress conditions.
