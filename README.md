## About

My Research focuses on organic compounds in the geosphere and the use of stable sulfur isotopes to better understand the sulfur and carbon cycle in the subsurface.
I am interested in the role organic sulfur compounds play in preservation of organic matter and subsequent cracking of kerogen under thermal stress conditions.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/IlyaKutuzov/IlyaKutuzov.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
