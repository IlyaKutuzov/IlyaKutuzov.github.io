## About
I am a PhD candidte at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My PhD project focuses on volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) - these compounds occur naturally in natural gas and are known to degrade the gas/petroleum quality and pose a heatlh risk to exposed workers and nearby communities. Often, these sulfur compounds are accompanied by H<sub>2</sub>S which is highly poisonus, corrosive and explosive.<br/>
The aims of my project are to identify the various VOSC in natural gases, understand their pathways of formation and possible sinks and finally, provide a VOSC-based-proxy for H<sub>2</sub>S presence and sources within a given reservoir, or even basin.

## Research interests
My main interests are:
- The sulfur and carbon cycles in the subsurface from processes during diagenesis of organic matter up to formation of sulfur-compounds during catagenesis and cracking of fossilized organic matter.
- Transport of pollutants from oil spills to soil, ground water and their interactions with the mineral phase.
- Source rocks in the Southern Levant region- Many oil and gas occurences in the area are yet to be linked to their source rocks. Identification of source rocks in the area is of major importance for reconstraction of paleoenvironmental conditions on land and at the deposition basin.

### *Identification of a pollutant on the Israeli coast ("Tar pollution")*
Our laboratory recieved samples of the "tar" that contaminated the Israeli coastline in February 2022. Within a few days I analyzed the contaminant and concluded it is most likely a crude oil rather than tar- therefore implying a different strategy for source-identification and treatment.<br/> My [report](/assets/documents/Feb_2022_oil_spill_report.pdf) was submitted the the Israeli Ministry of Environment (and later to the press) who originally ignored it but after a year [acknowledged](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/opinion-column_rani_amir) the pollutant is indeed a crude oil.
