## About
I am a recent PhD graduate from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My PhD project focused on volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) - these compounds occur naturally in natural gas and are known to degrade the gas/petroleum quality and pose a heatlh risk to exposed workers and nearby communities. Often, these sulfur compounds are accompanied by H<sub>2</sub>S which is highly poisonus, corrosive and explosive.<br/>
In my PhD project I characterized the different VOSC that occur in natural gases, proposed different pathways for their formation and developed a set of VOSC-based geochemical proxies for correlating gas-source rocks and identification of H<sub>2</sub>S presence and sources within a given reservoir, or even basin.

## Research interests
My main interests are:
- The sulfur and carbon cycles in the subsurface from processes during diagenesis of organic matter up to formation of sulfur-compounds during catagenesis and cracking of fossilized organic matter.
- Abiotic synthesis of sulfur compounds and their role in the emergence of life on Earth.
- Evolution of biomarkers in organic matter from the Paleozoic Era with emphasis on anoxic environments.
- Transport of organic pollutants from oil spills to soil, ground water and their interactions with the mineral phase.

## When not in the lab
I manage the Mineralogy and Petrology collection at the National Natural History Collections ([NNHC](https://nnhc.huji.ac.il/?lang=en)) and take part in various cave surveys as a member of the Israeli Cave Research Center ([ICRC](https://www.malham.info/))

## Achievments and things I am proud of
### *Saving Ayalon cave*
In late 2021 I was invited to speak at the [Israeli Planning Administration (IPA)](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/iplan/govil-landing-page) as part of a scientific panel focused on the importance of the Ayalon cave. My presentation highlighted the risks faced by the local aquifer due to introduction of organic-contaminants and changing of the aquifer redox state- both of which were expected to occur due to [proposed construction of a railroad line](https://mavat.iplan.gov.il/SV4/1/99000957231/310). The joint scientific effort led to [changes](https://new.huji.ac.il/news/%D7%91%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%98%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%90-%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%92%D7%A2) in the original construction plan and the formation of a long-term monitoring project at the cave and surrounding aquifer.

### *Identification of a pollutant on the Israeli coast ("Tar pollution")*
Our laboratory recieved samples of the "tar" that contaminated the Israeli coastline in February 2022. Within a few days I analyzed the contaminant and concluded it is most likely a crude oil rather than tar- therefore implying a different strategy for source-identification and treatment.<br/> My [report](/assets/documents/Feb_2022_oil_spill_report.pdf) was submitted the the Israeli Ministry of Environment (and later to the [press](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001362101)) who originally ignored it but after a year [acknowledged](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/opinion-column_rani_amir) the pollutant is indeed a crude oil.

### *Study of an oil spill in arid condition*
I was a part of a group that studied the chemistry of oil spilled at the Evrona Nature Reserve. Our joint effort led to identification of previously unknown pollution event at the area and helped understand the mechanisms of oil degredation in the desert soil under arid conditions. The work was published in Nimrod Arvatz's Msc work.
