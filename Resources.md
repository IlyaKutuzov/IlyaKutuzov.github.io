## Test
I am a multidisciplinary Earth scientist and geochemist with passion for combining experimental laboratory work with field work. My current research focuses on the formation of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) by abiotic synthesis. Identfiyng abiotic formation mechanisms of VOSC may provide insights for the emergence of life on Earth as some VOSC were demonstrated to aid the formation of peptide bonds. Alongside my research, I teach geology courses at the Open University of Israel. <br/>

## Research interests
- Abiotic synthesis of organic sulfur compounds and their role in the emergence of life on Earth.
- Evolution of biomarkers in organic matter from the Paleozoic Era with emphasis on anoxic environments.
- The sulfur and carbon cycles in the subsurface from processes during diagenesis of organic matter up to formation of sulfur-compounds during catagenesis and cracking of fossilized organic matter.
