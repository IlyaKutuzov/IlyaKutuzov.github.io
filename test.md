## Resources
* My [Master's thesis](/assets/documents/MSc_Thesis_IK.pdf) on the physical and chemical propeties of early stage, immature oils, produced from the Israeli oil shale.
* My [PhD dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLeFpJb09PqgAnO9EWyKDkwDVE9jTdT4/view?usp=sharing) on volatile organic sulfur compounds in natural gas.
Interested in my PhD work but dont want to read the whole thing? Check out my thesis defence talk:

* Wonder why Israel is called "the holey land"? Check out this map of [oil and gas boreholes drilled in Israel and Northern Sinai](/assets/datasets/Oil_Gas_Wells_Israel_Sinai_v1.kmz):

All standard data (location, depth etc...) is available when clicking each borehole. In addition, publications and reports of relevant wells are referenced therein.
### *Reports and conference posters*
* Want to know what oil was found in Israel and where does it come from?
